PAPER FEATURES:

Any code required for pre-processing the data is included in the code 
The paper specifies how the dataset was split into a training, validation and test set
Online (or, if unfeasible, offline) data augmentation was used in the experiments
All sources used to design/implement the proposed solution are referenced in the paper
Results are evaluated on an independent test set, not used during training
Hyper-parameters are reported for all experiments discussed in the paper
The paper states the number and range of values tried per (hyper-) parameter during development of the paper, along with the criterion used for selecting the final parameter setting
Appropriate quantitative performance metrics are defined and used to report the results
A few qualitative examples are included in the report (if feasible)
Potential failure cases are discussed
All figures and tables are readable with clear fonts
All figures  have clearly labeled axis
All figures and tables have captions that describe their contents
images with readable fonts and axis and captions
