TODO:


- talk about the model, we used fasterrcnn cuz its easy to customize, and also we conjecture 2 stage is better than single shot (see yolo results)
- show how fasterrcnn works and why it doesn't work for use, how we solved the problem for 5k classes
- explain custom model, loss, class weights
